# Advent of Code 2018

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles released in December, with the narrative that you need to help the elves complete the puzzles in order to save Christmas! The puzzles get progressively more difficult as the days go on, and can be solved in any programming language.

I chose to solve the puzzles in Python, and my solutions are attached in jupyter notebooks. As someone new to a lot of CS concepts I found Advent of Code super fun, addictive and at times, challening!
